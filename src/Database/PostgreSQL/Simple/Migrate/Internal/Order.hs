-- Stability   : experimental

-- This is an internal module of "Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Migrate",
-- you probably want that module instead.  Anything exported by this
-- module that is not also exported by the main module is subject
-- to change without notice.
--
-- This module contains the things we can do without querying the
-- database- including basic sanity checks and ordering of the
-- migrations.
